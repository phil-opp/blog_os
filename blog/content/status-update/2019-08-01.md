This post gives an overview of the recent updates to the _Writing an OS in Rust_ blog and the used libraries and tools.

Since I'm still very busy with my master thesis, I haven't had the time to work on a new post. But there were quite a few maintenance updates this month and also a few new features such as the new `OffsetPageTable` type in the `x86_64` crate.

We also had some great contributions this month. Thanks to the efforts of [@64](https://github.com/64), we were able to considerably lower the compile times of the `x86_64` and `bootloader` crates. Thanks to [@Aehmlo](https://github.com/Aehmlo), the `cargo-xbuild` now has a  `cargo xdoc` subcommands and support for the `cargo {c, b, t, r}` aliases.

The following list gives a short overview of notable changes to the different projects.
